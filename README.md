# Project1-Predict-Bike-Sharing-Demand-with-AutoGluon

This notebook is the result of my work on the project **Predict Bike Sharing Demand with AutoGluon** for the course **Introduction to Machine Learning** of **AWS Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree** from Udacity.
The aim of this work is to train, test, and optimize an AutoGluon Tabular prediction model to illustrate the use of auto ML in automating and speeding model training and evaluation, and how basic techniques of feature engineering can improve performance.
The data used is the kaggle "bike sharing demand" dataset (Fanaee-T, H & Gama, J. 2014). It is a datetimeindex dataset with hourly information on bike sharing demand starting from January 1th 2011 until December 19th 2012 with gaps of nearly 10 days in datatime sequence starting from 20th till the end of each month. The dataset contains features such as hourly information about season, several weather variables, workingdays and holidays, basically.
